            One of the hards ohn i know, Allan Muatle We’ve weathered terrible storms
            Had fights, shared laughs, made memories that would always make me smile and bring me joy.
            I simply wonder how dark and depressing my life would be without you in it. Gems, Diamonds
            Precious stones They all come with a price tag But with you, our friendship, is beyond worth. You’re priceless.
            I asked for a brother and I got a best friend Whom I can pour my heart to without the fear of being judged
            Flaws, mistakes and all. You accept me for who I am Please continue being my pillar and a friend

        <h2>frontend Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Every website has a frontend; it’s everything about the service a user will actually see. Because it’s what 
            users interact with, the frontend has to be accessible, well-designed, intuitive for the user, and it has to perform well.
            Frontend development is a specialism of software development. In simple terms, the frontend of a website is the part users 
            actually see and interact with, what’s known as the user interface (UI). Every website has a UI in some form.

        <h2>Programmer!!</h2>
        <p>
            Alternatively referred to as a coder or software developer, a programmer is an individual who writes code or 
            creates software for a living. Many programmers who program for a profession have a college degree in computer science. 
            While each job differs, most programmers are responsible for creating the software program or parts of a program, 
            debugging problems, or adding onto a program.
